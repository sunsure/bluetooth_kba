# INTRODUCTION

This repository gathers the knowledge base articles and corresponding code examples produced by the bluetooth support team. It keeps a curated index of all the Bluetooth related KBAs divided into logical categories for an easier and more convenient look-up. It may also include non-KBA content which is relevant for designing your Bluetooth application (e.g. app notes or web pages).

If you are just getting started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth solutions then your starting point should be [QSG108: Getting Started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth Software](https://www.silabs.com/documents/login/quick-start-guides/qsg108-bluetooth-software-getting-started.pdf). At the end of that document you are presented with the flowchart below which shows what documents should be read and in which order. Additionally you can check out our [Bluetooth Training](https://www.silabs.com/support/training/bluetooth) page for more training material.
